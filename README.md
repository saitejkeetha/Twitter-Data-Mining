# Twitter-Data-Mining
firstly, we used twitter as our data source, for collecting information from twitter, we used Tweepy it is a open source python package to access data from Twitter APIs such as REST API for data extraction .PyMong is a python distribution tool for working with MongoDB. 
Furthermore, we used AWS for executing jupyter notebook on remote server by using internet. we imported Tweepy to jupyter and used twitter credentials to extract the recent data and this extracted data is stored in MongoDB with the help of PyMongo library which is installed and imported in jupyter. 
It allows interaction with MongoDB databases through Python. Next, we need to create a MongoClient object which represents a client connection to a MongoDB server. This data store in MongoDB database is used for representing data visually by using Mongodb charts.
